# plant_disease_detection

The  Basic Model:
This has the whole trained data code for Each Plant class model. Model varies according to their Accuracy.

Static:
It has the Css and Javascript files.

Templates:
As named it  has the templates for  the flask app. No need to change unless required by your side.

Uploads:
It stores the images uploaded to the flask app for disease detection.

File with .py  extension:
You just have to run all the files individually without editing the code. (**Primary Task** after downloading the whole file)

After running each .py file you will get another files with the  extension .h5 saved in the same directory with .py file. No need to displace them. Just come to app.py file and run it.
.h5 files are the weights of the models which will help your model to predict the disease. It is a HDF5 class file. Usually it stores weights and bias of the models

app.py:
It has the basic on run interface code for the whole model.
